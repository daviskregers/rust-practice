# Learning Rust

Previously, about a year ago I went through [rust courses](https://github.com/daviskregers/learning-rust), but haven't really used rust since.

Decided to go through this [Rust Projects YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jp7sabBCp4&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDD5vy2BuSHvFZU0a6RDmgb) to recap on the language and actually make something.

Contains projects:
1. Port Snifffer CLI
2. Snake Game
3. Chat Application
4. CLI Toy Blockchain
